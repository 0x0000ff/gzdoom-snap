# gzdoom-snap

The source-port of the Doom engine in a snap along with a graphical launcher for launching wads and pk3s.

All game files should go into the ~/snap/gzdoom/current/.config/gzdoom. You may have to create a folder or run the game first in order for the folder to show up.

This is my first attempt at making a snap. I might return to this in the future and see what changes I can make to it.
